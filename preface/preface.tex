These notes are intended to help new students come up to speed on the
common methods used in computational hydrodynamics for astrophysical
flows.  They are written at a level appropriate for upper-level
undergraduates.

These are very much a work in progress, likely not spell-checked, and 
definitely not complete.  Contributions are welcomed.  The \LaTeX\ source
for these notes is available online on github at: \\[0.25em]

Simply fork the notes, hack away, and submit a pull-request to add
your contributions.  A PDF version of the notes is always available

These notes are updated at irregular intervals, usually when I have a
new student working with me, or if I am using them for a course.

The best way to understand the methods described here is to run
them for yourself.  There are two sets of example codes that
go along with these notes.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \hydroex\ is a set of simple 1-d, standalone python scripts
  the illustrate some of the basic solvers.  Many of the figures
  in these notes were created using these codes---the relevant
  script will be noted in the figure caption.  

  You can get this set of scripts from github at:\\
  \url{https://github.com/zingale/hydro_examples/}

  References to the scripts in \hydroex\ are shown throughout
  the text as: \\[0.5em]
  \hydroexdoit{scriptname}

  More details on the codes available in \hydroex\ are described
  in Appendix~\ref{app:hydroex}.

\item  
  The {\sf pyro} code is a 2-d program that has
  solvers for advection, diffusion, compressible and incompressible
  hydrodynamcs, as well as multigrid.  It is designed to make 
  experimentation easy.  

  You can download {\sf pyro} at: \\
  \url{https://github.com/zingale/pyro2/} 

  A brief overview of \pyro\ is given in Appendix~\ref{app:pyro},
  and more information can be found at: \\

\end{enumerate}

These notes benefited from numerous conversations with Ann Almgren,
John Bell, Alan Calder, Chris Malone, \& Andy Nonaka.
