These notes are intended to help new students come up to speed on the
common methods used in computational hydrodynamics for astrophysical
flows.  They are written at a level appropriate for upper-level
undergraduates.  The focus is on discussing the {\em practical issues}
that arise when implementing these methods, with less emphasis on the
underlying theory---references are provided to fill in details where
necessary.

These are very much a work in progress, likely not spell-checked, and
definitely not complete.  The page size is formatted for easy reading
on a tablet or for 2-up printing in a landscape orientation on
letter-sized paper.

These notes are updated at irregular intervals, usually when I have a
new student working with me, or if I am using them for a course.

The best way to understand the methods described here is to run
them for yourself.  There are two sets of example codes that
go along with these notes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \hydroex\ is a set of simple 1-d, standalone python scripts
  that illustrate some of the basic solvers.  Many of the figures
  in these notes were created using these codes---the relevant
  script will be noted in the figure caption.  

  You can get this set of scripts from github at:\\
  \url{https://github.com/zingale/hydro_examples/}

  References to the scripts in \hydroex\ are shown throughout
  the text as: \\[0.5em]
  \hydroexdoit{scriptname} \\[0.5em]
  Clicking on the name of the script will bring up the source code
  to the script in your web browser.

  More details on the codes available in \hydroex\ are described
  in Appendix~\ref{app:hydroex}.

\item  
  The \pyro\ code~\cite{pyro} is a 2-d simulation code with
  solvers for advection, diffusion, compressible and incompressible
  hydrodynamcs, as well as multigrid.  Low Mach solvers are 
  in development.  \pyro\ is designed with clarity in mind and to make 
  experimentation easy.  

  You can download \pyro\ at: \\
  \url{https://github.com/zingale/pyro2/} 

  A brief overview of \pyro\ is given in Appendix~\ref{app:pyro},
  and more information can be found at: \\

\end{enumerate}

These notes benefited immensely from numerous conversations and an ongoing
collaboration with Ann Almgren, John Bell, \& Andy Nonaka---pretty much
everything I know about projection methods comes from working with them.
Discussions with Alan Calder and Chris Malone have also been influential
in the presentation of these notes.
