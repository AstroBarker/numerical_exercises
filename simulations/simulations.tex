\section{How to setup a simulation?}

Astrophysical flows involve a range of length and timescales.  Often
it is not possible to capture all these scales in a single simulation,
so some comprimises must be made.  

\section{Picking your resolution}

To capture turbulence, you need a large range of lengthscales to get a
high Reynolds number.  

If nuclear burning is modeled, the steepness of the reaction rate will
set a lengthscale.


Hydrostatic equilibrium also puts demands on the resolution.

It is important to understand that no single algorithm will offer everything
you need.
