-- add to Ch 1 a review of numerical methods:

   . truncation vs. roundoff error
   . numerical differentiation and integration
   . ODEs
   . linear algebra

-- add section to each chapter: "Numerical Explorations"

   . create a separate, non-pyro git repo that has basic examples for all 
     of the methods in 1-d also add discussions from pyro.
   . start with simple grid class and BC discussion 
   . 1-d advection example


-- preface:

  "Each of the main chapters has 2 sections at the end: "Numerical
  Explorations" and "Going further".  The first guides the reader
  through some exercises using the codes in the git repo associated
  with these notes.  The latter briefly discusses some of the popular
  extensions done to the core algorithms discussed here, with pointers
  to the relevant papers in the literature.
