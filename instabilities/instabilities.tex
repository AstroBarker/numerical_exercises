Turbulence and instabilities are ubitiquous in astrophysical flows.  
A proper treatment of them requires resolving the important lengthscales
Furthermore, it is three-dimensional


\section{Turbulence}

Astrophysical flows are characterized by large Reynolds numbers.  

Turbulent eddies cascade between scales, owing to the nonlinear advective 
term in the momentum equation: $\mathbf{U} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{U}$.
