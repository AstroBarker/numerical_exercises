Notes on numerical methods for computational astrophysical hydrodynamics.

These notes describe the way I think about the numerical methods commonly
used with grid-based codes in astrophysical hydrodynamics.  The notes
are written in LaTeX, and should build by typing 'make' in the main
directory.

A PDF version of these notes is available at:

There are two sets of companion codes that go along with these notes:

*hydro_examples*: https://github.com/zingale/hydro_examples

  > simple, standalone, 1-d solvers that illustrate the basic ideas.

*pyro*: https://github.com/zingale/pyro2

  > pyro is a 2-d full simulation code designed with simplicity in
  > mind that implements the core solvers described in these notes
  > along with various test problems.
