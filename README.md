Notes on numerical methods for computational astrophysical hydrodynamics.

These notes describe the way I think about the numerical methods commonly
used with grid-based codes in astrophysical hydrodynamics.  The notes
are written in LaTeX, and should build by typing 'make' in the main
directory.

There are two sets of companion codes that go along with these notes:

*hydro_examples*: https://github.com/zingale/hydro_examples

*pyro*: https://github.com/zingale/pyro2

hydro_examples and simple, standalone, 1-d solvers that illustrate
the basic ideas.

pyro is a 2-d full simulation code designed with simplicity in mind
that implements the core solvers described in these notes along with
various test problems.
