\section{Version control}

Version control gives you the ability to keep track of changes to your
source, interact with other developers on the same project, and to
roll back changes when bugs are introduced.  It is easy to get started
and is perhaps the single most important part of code development for
everyone.  

There are several choices for version control, split loosely between
centralized systems and distributed version control systems.  In the
former category are CVS and subversion---these have been around for a long
time and are still in wide use, but not recommedned for starting a new project.
Mercurial and git are the two most popular distributed version control
systems, each actively used.  There are some subtle differences between
the two, but generally the workflow in each system follows the same ideas.

\section{Testing}

There are several types of testing that are important in computational
hydrodynamics.  When concerning source code quality, {\em unit testing}
and {\em regression testing} are invaluable in making sure that your
code works as designed and that you don't change the results as you 
continue to develop.
